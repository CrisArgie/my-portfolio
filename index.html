                    IoT-Based Direct Solar Dryer with SMS Notification (IDSD-SMS) for Sardinella Fish
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    The article discusses the traditional method of drying fish in the Philippines and how it can be unreliable and costly due to weather conditions. To address this, the authors developed an IoT-based direct solar dryer with SMS notification (IDSD-SMS) that monitors temperature, heat index, and humidity to properly dry fish. The system was successful in achieving desired results and sending SMS notifications to the user. A web portal was also created for remote monitoring. This technology could help improve traditional sun drying and may serve as a benchmark for drying other food products.
